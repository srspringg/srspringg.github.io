  <p> Hello! My name is Shane Spring, and I'm a freshman at Columbia University. As of now, I plan on majoring in Economics-Political Science since it combines my interests in both business and social change. I'm extremely passionate about brand marketing, journalism, and tech, and I hope to pursue a career that enables me to combine my interests and leave a lasting impact on the world.</p>

  I'm super passionate about advancing racial literacy, and I believe one of the best ways to do it is through stories.

  I've been watching YouTube videos since the fourth grade. To me, YouTube is a place where people can show who they really are through their content.

<a href = "https://www.nytimes.com/"> The New York Times: </a>
  Ever since I took my first journalism class in freshman year, I've looked to the New York Times as an example of great journalism. One of my favorite investigative pieces follows the life of a <a href = "https://www.nytimes.com/projects/2013/invisible-child/index.html#/?chapt=1"> Invisible Child </a> homless girl in NYC.
