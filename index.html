  <p> Hello! My name is Shane Spring, and I'm a freshman at Columbia University. As of now, I plan on majoring in Economics-Political Science since it combines my interests in both business and social change. I'm extremely passionate about brand marketing, journalism, and tech, and I hope to pursue a career that enables me to combine my interests and leave a lasting impact on the world.</p>
