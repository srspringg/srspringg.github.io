As of now, I plan on majoring in Economics-Political Science since it combines my interests in both business and social change.

  <h2> Interests</h2>
  <p>
    -
    <a href =" https://www.tiktok.com/en/"> Tik Tok:</a>
    Aside from being a hub of various dances and catchy songs, I think it's super cool how so many brands are using Tik Tok to better connect with Gen Z consumers.

    <a href = " https://www.chooseorg.org/" > CHOOSE: </a>
    I'm super passionate about advancing racial literacy, and I believe one of the best ways to do it is through stories.

    <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/" > YouTube: </a>
    I've been watching YouTube videos since the fourth grade. To me, YouTube is a place where people can show who they really are through their content.

    <a href = "https://www.nytimes.com/"> The New York Times: </a>
    Ever since I took my first journalism class in freshman year, I've looked to the New York Times as an example of great journalism. One of my favorite investigative pieces follows the life of a <a href = "https://www.nytimes.com/projects/2013/invisible-child/index.html#/?chapt=1"> homeless girl </a> in NYC.

  <h2> Work Experience</h2>
  <p class="special"> - Princeton Partners:</p>
  <p>
    In my role as Brand Marketing and Research Intern at Princeton Partners, I conducted weekly research on various topics that were assigned by the Chief Executive Officer. All of this research culminated in valuable audience insights that I presented to leadership within the agency and to the agency’s respective clients. In particular, I authored a white paper on the relationship between student and staff engagement and graduation rates. This paper was comprised of thorough qualitative and quantitative research and was extremely valuable to the agency’s client, The College of New Jersey. Moreover, I also developed a partnership marketing strategy to boost brand awareness for the company’s startup. I had the pleasure of working with representatives from the National Wildlife Federation and the World Wildlife Fund to develop a mutually beneficial relationship between them and Princeton Partners’ startup.

    - Princeton Alliance Church: As a Social Media Intern at Princeton Alliance Church, I worked to develop a robust social media strategy to meet the ministry’s key objectives. Using valuable data from Instagram and Facebook analytics, I produced relevant and engaging content for the ministry’s target demographics. My planning resulted in the ministry increasing their Instagram engagement by 42%. In addition, by the end of the internship, I was able to ensure that the ministry had a cohesive brand identity across social media platforms such as Instagram and Facebook.

    - The Tower: During my junior and senior year of high school, I served as the Managing Editor of The Tower, Princeton High School's student-run newspaper. In this role, I diversified the narratives the paper reported on by increasing reporting on demographics such as low-income, minority, and ESL students. Furthermore, I was able to foster a strong sense of community amongst the 20+ editors by organizing bonding activities, scheduling check-ins, and fostering a more collaborative culture at the paper as a whole. The Tower recieved the Gold Circle Award from the Columbia Scholastic Press Association in 2018 which recognizes excellence in student journalism.
  </p>
  <p>
    - The Ivy: As a senior in high school, I served as the Managing Editor of Princeton High School's newspaper, The Ivy. In this role, I strategized with the Editor in Chiefs on branding and vision for the magazine, reviewed all written and visual submissions, and assisted staff members in working with Adobe InDesign and Adobe Photoshop.
